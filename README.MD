# Table of opensource NASA projects

NASA has opensourced around a thousand of applications. The full list is available at their website: [Opensource NASA programs](https://software.nasa.gov/) 

Obviosly this software could be used by lot of tech projects.
The thing is that it'll take a lot of time for one person just to read the description of the repositories. 

To be able to understand what's inside the repos I've parsed the website and saved results in csv for future analysis.

In the repo you'll [find final parced csv file](https://github.com/Difint/list-of-oss-nasa-sw/blob/main/nasa-opensource-sw.csv)

The parser itself is made in Jupyter Notebook using Python+Selenium+Pandas and available [here](https://github.com/Difint/list-of-oss-nasa-sw/blob/main/parser.ipynb)
