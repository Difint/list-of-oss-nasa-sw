These interfaces are state machines that describe legal sequences of method invocations of a component. Guards on method parameters are included in the automata transitions in order to capture more precisely the interface behavior of the component. The novelty of PSYCO is that it is the first software environment to combine symbolic approaches with automata learning. In particular, it uses a technique named concolic execution to compute guards and active automata learning to compute legal sequences of invocations. Concolic execution is a static analysis that executes a program concretely, while computing symbolic constraints and using them to automatically trigger different program behaviors in order to exhaustively explore the input space of a component. Existing concolic test case generation tools handle only very few data types (especially no float types) and no native calls (e.g., native implementation of trigonometric functions) and thus do not scale to industrial (and in particular aerospace) applications. The concolic execution engine in PSYCO (named JDART) overcomes many of these shortcomings. Active automata learning has been used as a dynamic analysis for generating control models of software components. A learning algorithm triggers a variety of executions on a target system, and based on the outcomes, produces models of the component. These models are automatically refined based on counterexamples that demonstrate imprecisions of each proposed model. Concolic execution and active automata learning target two different types of component invariants: data invariants and control invariants. The combination of both allows the formulation of precise interfaces, integrating control and data aspects of components. Existing interface generation tools usually focus on one of these two aspects and do not combine constraints on inputs and outputs with control models.",Open Source,https://github.com/psycopaths/psyco,Data Servers Processing and Handling,Ames Research Center,mailto:arc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov,"PSYCO: Predicate-based Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (PSYCO), is a software environment that generates precise Java component interfaces in an automated fashion.

This Sargassum spp. detection is an extended form of Hus approach to derive a floating algae index (FAI), which is defined as the difference between the reflectance at the near infrared band (NIR, 859 nm) (vegetation red edge) and the linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (SWIR, 1240 or 1640 nm). The Hus algorithm was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, but we extended it for use with the OLI bands (655, 865, and 1609 nm), which are comparable to MODIS bands (645, 859, and 1640 nm). We also developed a high resolution true color product to mask cloud pixels in the OLI scene by applying a threshold to top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances in the red (655 nm), green (561 nm), and blue (443 nm) wavelengths, and software to remove false positive identifications of Sargassum spp in the imagery. Hus algorithm derives a FAI for each Sargassum spp identified pixel. Our algorithm only flags the presence of Sargassum spp in an OLI pixel by indicating that any pixel with a FAI > 0.0 is a Sargassum spp pixel. Additionally, our software geo-locates the flagged Sargassum spp pixels identified in the OLI imagery into the U.S. Navy Global HYCOM model grid. One element of the model grid used, covers an area 0.125degree of latitude by 0.125 degree of longitude. An OLI pixel is only 30m by 30 m. To resolve the differences in spatial coverage, a scheme was developed in which the total number of Landsat OLI pixels within a grid element of the model are counted, and if more than 1% of those pixels are pixels flagged as containing Sargassum spp, then the geographical location within the model is annotated. The end product is an ASCII file that contains latitude, longitude pairs that are used as input for the next stage in the processing stream, which is a clustering algorithm or a model initialization parameter. The numerical model grid must be in p lace before the geolocation takes place.The focus of this application is the automatic identification of Sargassum spp. in visible data of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board LANDSAT-8 in the Gulf of Mexico.

The software utilizes input information of the airflow surrounding the body of interest and then calculates trajectories of approaching water droplets, the mass and energy transfer processes at the surface of the body, and the resulting ice mass and the shape it will take on the body. This version of the software includes coverage of the full range of icing conditions from the standard envelope encompassed by FAA CFR 14, Part 25, Appendix C, up through super-cooled large droplet (SLD) icing conditions. The computational results have been compared to an extensive database of ice shape profiles obtained from experimental measurements and the software has shown a very good ability to reproduce such profiles under most conditions of interest to the aviation community. This validation effort has made the LEWICE3D software one of the most extensively tested ice accretion prediction tools available. The LEWICE3D software is made up of several modules or processes. The first step is calculation of the flow field around the aircraft or aircraft component of interest. This calculation is performed prior to use of the LEWICE3D software and serves as input information for LEWICE3D. The results of this calculation are used to calculate the water droplet trajectories which impinge on the aircraft surface. The droplet trajectory analysis also produces the impingement limits and the local collection efficiency, which in turn are used to determine the mass of water that will impact a surface and the distribution of that water on the surface. The mass flux information is used for subsequent ice growth calculations and is also useful for ice protection system design.

Software components use the GMSEC Architecture API to connect to a middleware software messaging bus that in turn is responsible for message routing and delivery.

The API combined with the GMSEC message standards allow a component to be GMSEC-compliant and help it achieve plug and-play capability. Using standard messages for functionality helps the GMSEC environment achieve the goal of application interchangeability, where standardized components can be easily exchanged without affecting other GMSEC components. For a component to be considered GMSEC compliant, it must use the standard set of messages with the GMSEC API.

The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s. Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56 s. In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system. Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias. A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals. An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector. By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center. The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the "" one-per-revolution"" feature. Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module. Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited. magnetic bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station. In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance.",General Public Release,https://software.nasa.gov/request-form/LEW-17293-2,Design and Integration Tools,Glenn Research Center,mailto:grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov,"FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.

Automatic Discovery Of Precursors in Time series) is a data mining/ machine learning algorithm that processes large volumes of time series data and identifies precursors to adverse events. An adverse event may refer to any unsafe event ranging from a negligible safety hazard to a catastrophic accident, depending on the scope of the analysis. A precursor is an early indicator of an increasing likelihood of the adverse event. Identifying precursors is important in the context of a proactive safety management because precursors detect the increasing severity of the underlying hazard much earlier, giving sufficient time to identify, analyze and implement corrective actions. ADOPT analyzes large volumes of historical data to find complex trends among several sensory variables simultaneously to find precursors. ADOPT's data mining approach captures real-world effects such as human factors, weather, geographic constraints, operating procedures, airline strategies etc. that are difficult to capture using first-principle models. The following are ADOPT's capabilities - new functionality to discover precursors to events of interest by mining time series data, reduces the time required by subject matter experts to discover and analyze precursors from large volumes of data, detects the likelihood of the adverse event earlier to alert the operator on an impending failure, assists in explaining the event of interest with identified precursors. The ADOPT algorithm is a general methodology that does not make any special assumptions about the system and does not need specialized knowledge on the system states enabling it to operate directly on the observed time series data. Further, it can scale well to multivariate time series and can analyze large number of flights, which may enable a faster turnaround time for subsequent tasks such as hazard identification and safety risk analysis. A subject matter expert may require a few hours to analyze a flight for precursors which is not scalable considering the thousands of flights operated on a daily basis. Also, human experts may not be able to visualize hundreds of time series variables to notice complex variations and trends in the data. ADOPT may be used to speed this process by analyzing the thousands of flights that operate every day to short-list only the significant precursors which may then be analyzed by a subject matter expert, reducing the turnaround time for safety analysis. While the motivation to find precursors came from analyzing safety (negative events), the method is general to be applied to performance issues as well as to understand positive events such as finding precursors to a high throughput operation at an airport.",Open Source,https://github.com/nasa/ADOPT,Aeronautics,Ames Research Center,mailto:arc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov,"ADOPT (abbr.

The COMDES-MELT code computes the velocity, pressure, temperature, and flow angles at the leading edge and trailing edge of each blade row, at the hub, mean, and tip sections. This compressor code includes the ability to calculate the effects of water vapor on the fluid properties of the air water vapor mixture based on the mole fraction of air to water vapor. The relative humidity at the engine inlet is specified, and the local specific humidity (mass of water/mass of air) is computed through each component of the inlet-fan-LPC, taking the sublimation, melting, and evaporation of an ice particle into consideration, as well as the local air temperature. The resulting effect of the humid air on the performance of the compressor is computed. Several key parameters have been identified as early indicators of ice accretion: the local wet-bulb temperature, the melt ratio within each blade row, and the ice water flow rate to air flow rate ratio. The local wet-bulb temperature is calculated at each blade row. The geometry section of the code is defined by simple circular arc rotors and stators including stage axial gaps. As the ice particles passes though the compression rotors, stators, and gaps the ice particle melting and evaporation model computes the local melt ratio, change in enthalpy, and particle temperature and diameter through each compressor component. The ratio of ice water flow rate to the air flow rate is computed at the inlet based on the ice water content in the atmosphere and the mass flow rate of air entering the engine. If the limiting values of these key parameters are met, there is a risk that ice will accrete on the surfaces of the compressor.

At the core of the concept, there is a mathematical definition of the well-clear concept. Two aircraft are considered to be well clear of each other if appropriate distance and time variables determined by the relative aircraft states remain outside a set of predefined threshold values. These distance and time variables are closely related to variables used in the Resolution Advisory (RA) logic of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System Version II (TCAS II). DAIDALUS includes algorithms for determining the current well-clear status between two aircraft and for predicting a well-clear violation within a lookahead time, assuming non-maneuvering trajectories. DAIDALUS implements algorithms for computing maneuver guidance, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model for the ownship. Maneuver guidance is computed in the form of range of track, ground speed, vertical speed, and altitude values called bands. These bands represent areas in the airspace the ownship has to avoid in order to maintain well-clear with respect to traffic aircraft. In the case of a loss of well-clear, or when a well-clear violation is unavoidable, the maneuver guidance algorithms provide well-clear recovery bands. Recovery bands represents areas in the airspace that allow the ownship to regain well-clear status in a timely manner according to its performance limits. Recovery bands are designed so that they also protect against a user-specified minimum horizontal and vertical separation. DAIDALUS also implements a pair-wise alerting logic that is based on a list of increasingly conservative alert levels. DAIDALUS is implemented in C++ and Java. The definition of a family of well-clear volumes is also available in Matlab. The software library is modular and highly configurable. The functional requirements of DAIDALUS algorithms have been formally specified in the Prototype Verification System (PVS). The correctness of these algorithms with respect to their functional requirements has been formally verified in PVS.

In the case of a loss of well-clear, or when a well-clear violation is unavoidable, the maneuver guidance algorithms provide well-clear recovery bands. Recovery bands represents areas in the airspace that allow the ownship to regain well-clear status in a timely manner according to its performance limits. Recovery bands are designed so that they also protect against a user-specified minimum horizontal and vertical separation. DAIDALUS also implements a pair-wise alerting logic that is based on a list of increasingly conservative alert levels.DAIDALUS is implemented in C++ and Java. The definition of a family of well-clear volumes is also available in Matlab. The software library is modular and highly configurable. The functional requirements of DAIDALUS algorithms have been formally specified in the Prototype Verification System (PVS). The correctness of these algorithms with respect to their functional requirements has been formally verified in PVS. Furthermore, the software implementations have been validated against the formal models using stressing test cases.",

446,NPO-51796-1,https://software.nasa.gov/software/NPO-51796-1,Viewshed Tool (A CAMP/MMGIS Plugin),"A viewshed is the visible area seen from a location based on an observer's height and viewable area. Viewsheds are particularly useful for rover missions because they can aid tactical and strategic planning by answering questions like: ""What can we see from this rover position?"", ""Where do we need to drive to see this geological feature?"" and ""What geologic features am I seeing in this image?"" Viewsheds are often found in geographic information systems (GIS) where they are commonly rendered two-dimensionally as a region on a raster map in a binary representation to signify visible or not-visible. We implemented a viewshed algorithm based on an existing open source tool and adapted it to a web-based environment. This new Viewshed Tool has been added to the Multi-Mission GIS (MMGIS) web application and is in use by the Mars2020 Perseverance rover science and engineering team. The client-side JavaScript method the new Viewshed Tool uses is based on GDAL's gdal_viewshed function [1] and on the algorithms in [2]. The decision to implement the same viewshedding algorithm ourselves was driven by the need for custom functionalities, higher user interactivity, potential performance issues, translations to non-Earth radii, and because MMGIS already implements a tiled elevation data scheme for its 3D globe view.The viewshed algorithm by [2] avoids this growth and achieves constant calculation time between any source and destination by utilizing an ""auxiliary grid"" which enables the use of previous visibility computations to inform upcoming ones. The auxiliary grid keeps track of the actual or minimum elevation a coordinate becomes visible. These values are then used to compute the actual visibility of a further DEM point by generating a ""reference plane"" between the observer's point and two nearby auxiliary grid values (figure 1 in [2]). It then determines whether the DEM point has a position and elevation that falls above or below the plane (and then updates the auxiliary grid again accordingly). If it falls above, it's visible in the final viewshed, otherwise it is not.Our goal was to reshape and expand upon existing viewshed capabilities in [1] and build it out into a robust, performant, and interactive client-side tool.The first adaption was into our tiled raster data model. Tiling is a standard optimization to serve raster data to data-rich web applications. The Viewshed Tool works with our 3D Globe's tiles which are RGBA elevation band-encoded seam-overlapped pngs in the TMS tile structure. Before each viewshed is generated, the tool queries all visible tiles at the user's current extent and zoom level and assembles them into a single grid for the base algorithm. In the cases where the observer point is not in the user's current view extent, the tool intelligently queries all the tiles between the current extent and the observer, only grabbing the tiles that will influence the final viewshed. All tiles are cached using a custom client side method that saves time between viewshed generations and in some cases delivers real-time, click-and-drag viewshed generation. Tapping into the tiled data ecosystem also enabled us to manipulate zoom levels and provide viewsheds at varying resolutions. If a user has a slow connection, they could still generate a rough viewshed, whereas a power-user can still view it at the highest resolution (i.e. deeper zoom level). By incorporating tiled data support into our viewshed algorithm, we can boost performance, reuse data, and take a resolution-based approach.In addition, our implementation includes support to query viewshed regions within custom azimuth and elevation ranges simulating a camera field of view (FOV). We also can set a custom planetary radius to account for curvature in our viewsheds.References:[1] https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_viewshed.html[2] Wang et al. 2000, PE & RS, Vol. 66, No. 1, pp. 87-90.",Open Source,https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS%20or%20https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS/tree/master/src/essence/Tools/Viewshed,Data and Image Processing,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,mailto:sra@jpl.nasa.gov,"A viewshed is the visible area seen from a location based on an observer's height and viewable area.

For a given year, the PPET software package takes in temporally processed vegetation index data (3-D spatio-temporal arrays) generated by the Time Series Product Tool (TSPT) and outputs spatial grids (2-D arrays) of vegetation phenological parameters. As a precursor to PPET, the TSPT uses quality information for each pixel of each date to remove bad or suspect data, and then interpolates and digitally filters the time series to produce a continuous, smoothed vegetation index product in which data voids are eliminated. Both the TSPT and PPET use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite multi-spectral data as a default, but each software package is easily modifiable and could be used with any high-temporal-rate remote sensing system that is capable of producing vegetation indices. Unlike other known plant phenological parameter estimation software, the PPET produces not only common phenological parameters but also real-time and custom parameters without a priori assumptions about the shape of the phenological cycle. Common phenological parameters, like those produced in PPET, are associated with the annual vegetation growth cycle. They quantitatively describe vegetative states related to annual cyclical growing seasons, such as green-up, maturity, senescence, and dormancy, by analyzing the temporal shape of given vegetation index time series. The real-time phenological and custom parameters are formed from a cumulative sum (integral) produced at a fixed temporal interval. In addition, a cumulative vegetation index and time-specific/pest-specific phenological parameters can be designed to optimize the detection of vegetation damage from specific pests and diseases. These problem-specific phenological parameters have the potential to be integrated into near real-time, predictive surveillance systems (i.e. early warning systems) and, with improved vegetative state information, could assist decision makers in making intelligent vegetation and associated land resource management choices.

It was designed to determine the number of safe operational flights an aircraft can make without structural component failures due to fatigue crack growth. The computer program was developed after two rear B-52B pylon hooks failed simultaneously during an Armstrong test operation. Subsequent examinations revealed that hook failure was caused by rapid crack propagation from existing micro cracks that had been masked by chrome-plated surfaces and thus were undetected during visual inspections.</p> <p>To obtain baseline data for use in the program, the critical structural components must be proof-load tested to determine the initial theoretical crack size based on fracture mechanics. Next, strain gauges are installed in the vicinity of stress concentration points and are calibrated to record the applied loads. After the failure-critical components are identified, stress analysis is performed for each component to establish the functional relationship between the applied load and the induced tangential stress at the critical stress point. The program reads the data and selects the maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of the random flight loading spectra. Program outputs are used to generate and display crack growth curves, providing a visual warning for preventing catastrophic structural failures.</p> <p>For the B-52B pylon hooks discussed above, crack growth curves were produced for each hook, allowing visual observation of the crack growth behavior during the entire air-launching or captive flight.

One major obstacle for the implementation of statistical methods for UQ is the use of expensive computational models. Classical UQ methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generally require thousands to millions of model evaluations, and, when coupled with an expensive model, result in excessive solve times that can render the analysis intractable. These methods are also inherently serial, which prohibits speedup by high performance computing. Recently, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has emerged as a powerful alternative to MCMC. In contrast, this method allows for parallel model evaluations, realizing significant speedup. This software is an implementation of SMC that uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to provide users general access to parallel UQ methods in Python 2.7. To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python 2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be estimated, and provides data to be used for calibration.

As new surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCAM) become active in the next decade, the discovery rate is expected to increase tremendously. Coordination between various survey telescopes will be necessary in order to optimize NEO discoveries and create a unified global NEO discovery network. We are collaborating on a community-based, open-source software project to simulate asteroid surveys in order to facilitate such coordination and to develop strategies for improving discovery efficiency.

These include limits to instrument aperture, low communications bandwidth, and attitude control. Compensatory software based strategies for mitigating these limitations have recently been introduced in order to make efficient interplanetary small spacecraft a reality. These strategies move the zero-order science data analysis, traditionally completed on the ground, onboard the spacecraft. Moving the science analysis to the spacecraft allows for significant reductions in required bandwidth for sending crucial scientific data products. These techniques have additional potential for integration into larger interplanetary missions for increasing overall mission science return.In order to be practically deployed on flight hardware this software must have a small working memory footprint as well as minimal power requirements. The techniques can broadly be categorized as image radiometric calibration and target detection. Each of these processes is completed onboard the spacecraft, permitting efficient downlink of the finalized scientific data products.Strategies for early target detection utilize software functionality to support the limited aperture camera equipment available to small spacecraft platforms. Small aperture systems on a spacecraft with minimal pointing accuracy would challenge traditional optical navigation on these platforms; they would reduce single-frame image sensitivity to below the level needed for timely detection of a wide range of small, dark primitive body targets. We address this challenge with software strategies for early target detection that are appropriate for the limited aperture camera equipment available to small spacecraft platforms. This software enables onboard coaddition of multiple image data frames to increase the signal to noise ratio of the output product. The row/column shift between any two images can then be determined by calculating the shift in centroid for any reference star between two images. We search for the optimal cross-correlation over a finite search window based on the expected travel distance of the star field. Once these shift parameters are known for each image pair, the images are aligned and pixel values are combined. Coaddition is then performed on the aligned stack, increasing the signal to noise ratio to 7. In addition to increasing the fidelity of the data, the combination strategy uses a triplet-median method that filters single-pixel anomalies such as cosmic rays. This also reduces memory requirements because it is never necessary to store more than a few frames in memory at one time.A secondary objective is to detect any targets in the star field onboard, so that only the target row and column image coordinates need be downlinked. This involves two coadded image stacks acquired with a time difference permitting a shift in the target across the stationary star field. Applying a pixel value subtraction between the aligned images will eliminate the background star field, leaving only the target as an illuminated point source. The coordinate of the point source centroid is then recorded as an onboard data product for later use.",Open Source,https://github.com/JPLMLIA/NEAScout-Science,Data and Image Processing,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,mailto:sra@jpl.nasa.gov,"As small spacecraft begin to travel beyond low earth orbit, mission planners are likely to encounter platform constraints that may adversely affect operations and instrument design.

Small changes in the image of the speckled target caused by optical aberrations along the line-of-sight can be measured by cross-correlating the reference image with the 'wind on' image, yielding a map of the density gradients along the imaged path. The size of the speckles and their uniformity of illumination are critical to the success and sensitivity of the technique. BOS image data are recorded in real time using electronic CCD type cameras. However, processing and/or analysis of the traditional BOS image data is performed off-line after the test/experiment is completed. Advances in computer processing hardware enables the implementation of real-time processing and display of the BOS image data. Two different approaches to implementing the real-time BOS (RT-BOS) processing capability have been implemented. First, a traditional multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) based approach using scheduled parallel threads is used to build a RT-BOS processing engine. In the second approach, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) approach is used to construct a RT-BOS processing engine. Generally, high-core count CPU processors can provide a useful processing rate for RT-BOS. However, the GPU based approach exceeds the processing capability of the CPU approach, at a fraction of the cost. The GPU approach places no restrictions on the host PC processing capability, except that it be capable of acquiring the BOS image data from the camera in real-time.",U.S. Release Only,https://software.nasa.gov/request-form/LEW-20407-1,Aeronautics,Glenn Research Center,mailto:grc-sra-team@mail.nasa.gov,"Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is an optical technique for measuring density gradients in flow fields, in quiescent air or even liquids.

A SDS provides a platform to prototype, test, validate, and execute science data processing and analysis algorithms that can run at scale, efficiently, and reliably. Research and Analysis (R&A) projects use an SDS to analyze multisensor data to extract scientific knowledge. Flight projects use an SDS to process and reprocess raw instrument data to scientific measurements and higher-level data products. With Unity, algorithm developers have the power to rapidly implement algorithms and deploy an SDS to test and validate their algorithms at scale in a production-like environment. R&A projects with minimal operational requirements benefit because they have the ability to deploy robust and scalable SDSs without needing to hire a team of SDS engineers. Flight projects benefit from the availability of a ""flight-like"" SDS early in the development phase for the algorithm and science teams to test and validate algorithms. Moreover, the deployment of the production-quality SDS can be deferred to later in the project lifecycle, after the algorithms and production requirements are fully defined. Unity - a SDS-as-a-Service - unifies core SDS functions into services that can be offered as a product line; it unifies an SDS throughout the lifecycle of a project; it unifies the SDS workforce under a common goal and practices.The current SDSs in development or operations at JPL and broadly across NASA are one-of-a-kind systems that consist of vertically integrated components built to meet the specific needs of a project. This introduces major challenges to the organization, particularly for projects that have a lifecycle extending multiple decades. The SDS is built from the ground up, which causes long lead times (years) and, in turn, is inflexible to change. Costs are kept high because of minimal reuse, difficulties maintaining and sustaining the system, and the lack of scale to negotiate preferred rates with third-party vendors. Innovation is stifled because technologists are not motivated to evolve a one-of-a-kind system and it is difficult to sustain a trained workforce to maintain the system over a long time span. The software-as-a-service model, which is the basis for Unity, eliminates these challenges. SDSs are no longer deployed, they are now configured in a matter of weeks; reuse and economies of scale keeps cost to a minimum; innovation is possible because the impact is lasting and across multiple projects; and the workforce is consolidated with the capacity to support any project in any phase of its lifecycle. Working with Unity is straightforward.

For example, asserting the metadata validity of every file in the archive necessitates executing a validation algorithm across every asset file a process that would need to occur for all 650 million files. As such, executing an algorithm such as this takes between 500 ms to 1000 ms per file on a single node machine, and thus is predicted to take more than a ten years to complete, in total for all of our files, if performed sequentially on a single machine. Clearly, this task should and must be run in parallel to enable reasonable completion times. The question is: how much parallelization should we leverage? Our technical solution to this problem is to enable potentially unlimited parallel execution - dependent only on the task specifics and budget availability. Thus we present Archive Inventory Management System (AIMS), which is a massively parallel system allowing for validation of metadata or any other generic algorithm to be executed for all files on a system. AIMS builds on top of Amazon Lambda1, a cloud-computing infrastructure enabling on-demand processing of files using a server-less architecture, that allows the launch of as many parallel execution jobs as ones pricing considerations dictate. Theoretically, AIMS could enable the metadata validation of a significant proportion of our 650 million files in our archive in parallel, taking effectively a total execution time on the order of seconds to minutes2. With respect to AIMS, we will discuss technical considerations, architecture, and pricing models.Parallelization with respect to data processing will help achieve dramatically faster execution times for PDS IMG, however, this approach needs to be complemented with a parallelized software and configuration deployment strategy whether or not we leverage Amazon Lambda as our sole computational engine. Currently PDS IMG manages at least 15 non-cloud machines, running a variety of customer-facing and internal applications. Maintaining consistent configuration management, timely software updates, and addressing operating system discrepencies is a serious challenge. For example, one of our prime customer-facing applications, the PDS IMG Photojournal3 will require a software reployment workflow consisting of at least six software components and six separate machine reconfigurations. This all needs to be orchestrated with as little down-time as possible upon each software update, given the constant web-traffic Photojournal receives. In other words, we require parallel orchestration to reduce downtime. Thus, we present PDS IMG Ansible built upon and leveraging a parallelized IT-automation framework called Red Hat Ansible4. This next-generation automation framework allows PDS IMG to quickly redeploy software, data, media, configuration and documentation assets to any of our 15 machines (or cloud instances) in parallel to reduce downtime and enable centralized control of all our hardware resources. Most importantly, it enables the concept of deployment playbooks, which centralize and abstract the deployment tasks which need to be executed from the machines onto which they need to run.

936,NPO-50616-1,https://software.nasa.gov/software/NPO-50616-1,InSAR Processor For ALOS-2 Multi-Mode SAR Data And Ionospheric Correction,"This software implements the InSAR processing of ALOS-2 multi-mode SAR data and InSAR ionospheric correction based on the JPLs ISCE software. Like ISCE, the parameters are mainly handled by python programs, while image processing are mainly done by C or Fortran programs. When available, the basic modules of ISCE are called to do the processing and therefore the high processing efficiency of ISCE is inherited. ALOS-2 has many acquisition modes and different wavelengths. The unique feature of one app to support all can facilitate both the users and the maintenance of the software.The software continues to contribute to the numerous applications of the InSAR technology originally developed at JPL. In particular, the L-band ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry helps geophysicists to look at the large-scale and long-term deformation rates of many tectonically active areas. Many of these areas have dense vegetation and high reliefs, and C-band InSAR data does not work very well, while historical InSAR data usually have much smaller swath coverage. In addition, large-scale deformation of large earthquakes can also be measured with higher quality with L-band ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry. The support of multi-mode InSAR processing helps to get denser InSAR time series, which is helpful to look at the temporal evolution of the geophysical phenomena.",Open Source,https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2,Data and Image Processing,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,mailto:sra@jpl.nasa.gov,"This software implements the InSAR processing of ALOS-2 multi-mode SAR data and InSAR ionospheric correction based on the JPLs ISCE software.

937,NPO-50675-1,https://software.nasa.gov/software/NPO-50675-1,Neural Network Emulation Of VSWIR Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Models,"Conventional Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction evolved from multi-band approaches and generally does not exploit the full spectral measurement. We hypothesize that a pure spectroscopic approach can improve atmospheric inversion accuracy to minimize regional biases in global-scale investigations. Such techniques are pervasive in atmospheric remote sounding disciplines, where Optimal Estimation (OE) retrieval theory (Rodgers et al., 2000) inverts a radiance spectrum to recover a consistent physical model incorporating, for example, aerosol and H2O, the interactions between scattering, absorption, and the coupling between surface reflectance and atmosphere. This enables a statistically rigorous treatment of uncertainty with the potential to recover information on spectrally-broad signals. Our software demonstrates a proof of concept that overcomes the primary computational roadblock of these methods: fast execution of line-by-line Radiative Transfer (RT) models. Neural Network (NN) emulation can replicate the results of the MODTRAN 6.0 line-by-line A-band model to high accuracy and a five order of magnitude improvement in execution time. This demonstrates potential for OE to provide significant advances in the accuracy and modeling power of VSWIR atmospheric correction.",Open Source,https://github.com/pgbrodrick/sRTMnet,Data and Image Processing,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,mailto:sra@jpl.nasa.gov,"Conventional Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction evolved from multi-band approaches and generally does not exploit the full spectral measurement.
